I'm a **Senior Data Scientist at Perfios Software Solutions** and **Research Affiliate at Georgia Tech's Financial Services Innovation Lab**, specializing in financial reasoning models and production machine learning systems.

With a background in **Aerospace Engineering from IIT Kharagpur** and deep expertise in generative AI, I focus on building domain-specific reasoning models that operate efficiently in production environments.
